# Node Coffe shop finder
This is a simple coffee shop locator app built with pure Node.js—no fancy
Express or frameworks here! Inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCuefNScYKM), 
the goal was to keep things minimal and clean.

Dependencies? Just these ones:
- mysql2 for handling the database magic.
- sql-bricks to make building SQL queries a breeze.
- bcrypt for hashing passwords.
- ejs for rendering the views.

Keep it basic, stay caffeinated! ☕
